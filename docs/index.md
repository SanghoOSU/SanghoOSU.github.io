Hello! I am an assistant professor in the School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences at KAIST.
My research employs a variety of computational modeling and machine learning techniques to understand individual differences in human behaviors and brain activity,
with a special interest in developing artificial intelligence models that reflect psychological traits of humans.
