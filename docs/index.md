Hello! I am a postdoctoral fellow in [CCS lab](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) at Seoul National University.
As a cognitive scientist, I employ a variety of computational modeling and machine learning techniques to understand individual differences in cognitive traits, 
with the goal of gaining insight into central theoretical questions about human cognition.
