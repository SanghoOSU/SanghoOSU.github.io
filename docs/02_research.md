<h2>Overview</h2>
My research explores how people differ in cognitive traits such as attention, working memory, and numerical cognition. Human behaviors in psychological tasks typically show general trends at a population level yet differ greatly at an individual level. Exploring individual differences provides additional information about psychological constructs that underlie human behaviors.

I build and evaluate Bayesian cognitive models to provide parameters that would capture relevant properties of complex data, facilitating the analysis of individual differences. I also use machine-learning models based on Gaussian processes and deep neural network to identify individual differences in data-driven manners, and to address theoretical questions in novel ways.
